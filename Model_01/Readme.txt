Method 1 assumes that the datasets themself are also stored and searchable as (metadata) records within VuFind. In this case, there are several possibilities to access the linked datasets or publications on record list level or detailed record view level:

1 Record List:
- Facet Filtering: Format to "Dataset"
- Simple List of Datasets within Records in List (may need much space when many datasets are linked)
- Simple InFoLiS Button: Click leads to new (standard VuFind) Record List of the linked Resources. [Preferred Option]
- Simple InFoLiS Button: Click opens Popup with list of linked Resources.
- New Facet filter: Only show Datasets and linked Records in Record List. [PREFERRED]
- Simple InfoLis Button: Only Sign for linked Resources are available for this record. Klick on Button leads to detailed record view, where linked resources can be shown in any preferred option as described for 2 Detailed Record View.

2 Detailed Record View:
- List of linked Datasets in right column (above or below "Similar Items"): Links to detailed record view of the dataset
- List of linked Datasets in the Metadata table: Links to detailed record view of the dataset
- List of linked Datasets in a linked resource tab below the metadata table (next to existing tabs like "Holdings" or "Reviews") [PREFERRED OPTION]
- Simple InFoLiS Button: Click leads to new (standard VuFind) Record List of the linked Resources.
